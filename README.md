# PaintingGenNotebook
A jupyter Notebook for the "I’m Something of a Painter Myself" Kaggle competition.

This project was mostly just me following through the tutorial notebook by Amy Jang's: https://www.kaggle.com/code/amyjang/monet-cyclegan-tutorial. After that I tried working on improving/adding my own changes to it in an attempt to improve the model a bit. 

The goal of the project is to train a CycleGan model such that it can transform images into a similar Monet style painting.

The data come in the form of images and can be found on the kaggle competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started
